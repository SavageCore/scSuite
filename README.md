### Pre-requisites
######Place them in root directory (e.g. \SteamApps\common\PAYDAY 2)

~~[Harpoopus PayDay 2 LUA (LOL) Hook v3.0.3](http://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2/118779-harpoopus-payday-2-lua-lol-hook-v3-0-3-a.html)~~

~~[Decompiled HoxHud, thanks 90e](http://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/payday-2/118723-hoxhud-lua-dump-p2-2-a.html): Tested with P2.2~~

Neither of those are required as of now due to switching to the standard HoxHud install (waiting for decompiled version updates). Use SCSuite-uninstall.bat to clean your directory then install HoxHud as usual using Manual method explained at their group.

This is currently tested with

HoxHud P7.6
Payday2 v1.16.6 (Update 43)
